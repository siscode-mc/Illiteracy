# Illiteracy Mod

---

A server-side Minecraft mod centered on making villagers no longer able to provide end-game gear for free.  
Removes renewable sources of enchantments except for the enchanting table, and removes renewable sources for items that
are crafted with diamonds.

## Core changes

- Librarian villagers no longer sell enchanted books
- Smith villagers (armorer, weaponsmith, and toolsmith) no longer sell diamond gear
  - All diamond gear has been replaced with unenchanted golden gear

## Balance changes

- Using anvils to repair gear no longer increases the prior work penalty
- Anvils no longer break, under any circumstances (usage or falling)
- End cities have more diamond gear (and less iron gear)
- Axes and hoes can be found in end city treasure
- End city gear is much more likely to have mending on it
- Enchanted books found in treasure chests are much more likely to have mending
- Frost walker can be found in igloo basements, on either leather boots or books
- Armorer villagers now sell iron and gold horse armor
- Armorer villagers sell turtle shell helmets at master rank
- Smith villagers no longer buy diamonds in exchange for emeralds (why, mojang, why)
- Fishing no longer yields enchanted books as treasure
- Fishing can no longer yield enchanted fishing rods or bows

# FAQ

### So... why?

Because villagers were doing too much. We decided it was unacceptable how much advantage a player that rushes villagers
has over one that doesn't has had since the 1.14 update came out. We decided that diamond gear should never have been
made renewable and the enchantment table should never have been made obsolete. With this mod, villagers remain useful,
but can no longer be used to bypass the otherwise normal progression stages of the game.

### What does this mean for gameplay?

Getting a full set of enchanted gear is much more of a challenge and will require significantly more time investment.  
Enchantments which are categorized as treasure enchantments become non-renewable, and will require raiding structures to
obtain. These enchantments include:

- **Mending** can only be obtained on gear from end cities or by finding enchanted books. Items which cannot be obtained
  in end cities will require a mending book, which spawns only in overworld treasure chests.
- In particular, this means a mending elytra necessitates finding a mending book. Fortunately, they are fairly common in
  stronghold libraries, so make sure to search there before visiting the end.
- **Frost Walker** can be found commonly in igloos, but books of frost walker from igloos are only ever level one. It
  can still be found with vanilla probabilities in other treasure locations as well.
- **Curse of Binding** and **Curse of Vanishing** can be found on gear in end cities, but books with Curse enchantments
  are very rare, spawning only as overworld treasure. Curse of binding pumpkins (among other items requiring books) are
  now quite hard to produce, but are still technically obtainable

Additionally, some enchantment/item combinations become quite rare (though still renewable):

- **Unbreaking** can be obtained in the enchanting table for most items, but a book is required to enchant elytras,
  carrots/fungi on a stick, shields, flint and steel, and shears. You will need to enchant many books and hope for an
  unbreaking enchantment on them (5.3% of enchantment rolls) to obtain all items with unbreaking.
- **Thorns** enchantment can only be put on helmets, leggings, and boots through enchanted books, with only a 1% chance
  that it occurs on any book enchantment roll in the enchanting table, or a rare chance of finding it as treasure.
- **Trident** enchantments become difficult, as you must choose between re-rolling many times at the enchantment table
  with a grindstone until you get a perfect roll, rolling many books hoping for trident enchants (quite rare), or
  combining multiple tridents, necessitating killing *many* drowneds. (or more likely some combination of the three as
  necessary)

**Netherite** items also require more investment, as repairing with netherite is materially infeasible, so you will
probably not want to upgrade an item to netherite unless it has mending, which has become much harder to acquire.

To obtain fully enchanted gear will require either raiding *many* end cities or performing *many* enchantments at the
enchanting table, on top of the end city raiding and dungeon delving which is already necessary to obtain mending for
every gear piece. You will consume significantly more lapis, diamonds, and experience levels if you go with the
enchanting route, or a lot of time and stress if you raid end cities.  
A full set of enchanted gear will become a significant achievement, as we believe it was intended to be.

### Does this make anything unobtainable?

Technically, chipped and damaged anvils are no longer obtainable, but we do not consider this a loss. Everything else is
still obtainable, but many things have been made non-renewable.
